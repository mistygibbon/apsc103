## About the project
This GUI is built in 2023 Winter Term. The project aims to create a simple, user-friendly graphical user interface system (GUI) for the Queen's University Hyperloop Team.

## Objectives
- A simple system that can take input and output it clearly to the user​
- Provide information on the hyperloops metrics (time, velocity, acceleration, distance travelled, temperature, etc.)​
- Automatically generated graphs regarding hyperloop data​
- Notifying user when error occurs
